# Rosalind Solutions

baby's first repository... limping along learning Python plus the ins and outs of github :face_with_spiral_eyes: 

my solutions to [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) exercises :dna:

I'm still figuring out github - in the meantime I'm working locally in PyCharm and uploading my solutions as .py files... probably not so elegant, but I'm drinking out of a firehose of new info at the moment. It'll do :shrug:
